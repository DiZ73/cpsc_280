Difference between Library and Framework: A library is a method that you have not used that is a tool that comes into a program.
                                          A frameowrk is a program that abstractly invokes code when the instance of an event happenes
                                          in a program.

GUI's are known as effective frameworks.

Array Lists in general are a frameowrk. Because they are extensible. However, in java, they are used as a library.

In the class, you will not be writing a program from scratch. You will be reusing code.

Integration Tests: You run all the testcases that have accumulated in the development process of the software.

Safari.books online you will find software engineering by Frank Tsui and Orlando Karam - You can read through it for free.


A library performs specific, well-defined operations.

A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton.
The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

Examples of libraries: Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation,
math. Operations are self-contained.

Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application
defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about.
