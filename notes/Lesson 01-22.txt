Today we are looking at the Software development process.

Code and Fix:
For the process we have a Code and Fix with no designs and no specifications.
It's the easiest appraoch, to code as you go, and it may work better for small programs. (~200)
It's also the most expensive, since it's shortsighted, as there is no documentation, and no certainty.

You implement the first version, and you modify the unit until the client is satisfied. you have post delivery maintenance, and then 
the project retires.

Open Source Model:
Many Successful Projects such as the Linux Kernel, Eclipse, Web Browsers, and Apache Servers.
there are three informal stages of this.
  - One developer = builds initial version and distributes it over the web
  - people download it if there's intrest
  - there is development and mintenance
  Three types of maintenance (Corrective, perfective, adaptive)
  
  
Waterfall Model:
- On every phase, there is documentation.
- If there is a design, and we are using diagrams, everything is documented.
There is a rendition on this with the rapid prototype model which is the waterfall model, and the initial protype, with a
prototype at every stage of developoment in the project. (Spiral Model)

Spiral Model:
The spiral model takes a cyclic approach to incrementally develop software while analyzing risk at each iteration. It uses 
prototyping, and a review at each iteration commits the client, and developer to the next iteration.
It allows revisiting an earlier iteration for better alternatives.
Problems? : Over-reliance on risk identification & analysis - Who is the risk assesment expert?
