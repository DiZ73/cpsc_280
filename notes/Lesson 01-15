Reminders of the pervious lesson looking at PSP.

Overview through defect recording log. Defect recording logs are done in each stage of testing through the
Software Development testing cycle. However that doesn't include the fact that you can discover a defect without
running any testcases on your code. Any time you discover a defect, while coding, while talking to a friend, or while testing,
you can discover a defect, and you can log it.

There are defect types that are important to work through. PSP is a good baseline for actually recording every stage of the software 
development process. 

It allows you to see what past decisions you've made, and allows you to log what you've done.
