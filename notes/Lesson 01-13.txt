- The better we can learn about our habitts when it comes to programming, the better we can improve on ways
  in which we actually write code.
  
Methodology in writing software:
• Requirements:	 Describe	what	the	client	wants	the	system	to	do Testing
• Analysis:	 Describes	what the	system	will	do
• Design:	 Describes	how the	system	will	do	it
• Implementation:	 Coding	 the	system	as	designed
• Testing:	 Asserts	that	the	system	works	as	described

Software Engineers are to design solutions for X problems.

The difference between functional and Non-functional requirements is based on what the user wants.

When planning for the time it takes to write software you need to take all variables into account. There are
several stages when it comes to writing a program. (PSP - Watts S Humphrey)

PSP0 is the baseline process:

The principal objective of PSP0, the baseline process, is to provide a framework for writing your first PSP program and for
gathering data on your work. The data from the first PSP programs provide a comparative baseline for determining the impact
of the PSP methods on your work. The PSP0 process is shown in simplified form in Figure 2.1. The scripts guide you through
the process steps, the logs help you to record process data, and the plan summary provides a convenient way to record and
report your results.

The PSP0 process provides the following benefits:
- Image A convenient structure for performing small-scale tasks
- Image A framework for measuring these tasks
- Image A foundation for process improvement
